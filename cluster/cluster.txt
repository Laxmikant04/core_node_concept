Cluster -
	-By default NOdeJs uses single thread to serve all the requests .To make effective use of multi-core processor system and to provide multi threading
	NOde Js clusters are used.
	-Master thread can fork new child threads also known as workers.
	- When a new worker is forked , it re-run the whole code .
	- All the forked child thread (workers ) shares the same port as master thread , this is done through IPC.
	
How cluster devides requests between available workers-

-LINUX 
	- on linux system , cluster used round-robin (cluster.SCHED_RR approch to distribute requests among the available workers

-WINDOWS		
	-on windows system ,it uses cluster.SCHED_NONE approch.(which means leave it upto the operating system).
	And it's the only other option avaibale apart from round robin approch.
