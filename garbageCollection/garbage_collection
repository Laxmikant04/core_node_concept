object memory graph -

The object memory graph in JavaScript is a collection of all objects and their references.
 The reference path from the most immediate context up to the top is called a retaining path.

 Garbage collection- 
 Garbage collection is an automatic memory management process that operates in runtime. 
 It uses a mark-and-sweep algorithm that tracks all the paths and finds all objects in the object graph tree that are referenced from their roots.
 
 
garbage collector maintains two spaces -
1. New space
2. Old space

New space is where objects or variables re assigned memory .  Garbage collection is fast in this space .
The objects which live longer i.e. survives 2 GC cycle in this space are moved to Old space. Normally only 20% of all objects are moved to old space.
Garbage collection is very expensive in Old space. 

V8 engine uses mark-and-sweep algo to perform garbage collection in Old space.


Memory leak-
The memory assigned to the objects is expcted to release once objects are no longer in use But due to some reason it does not releases the memory .
That is called memory leak.

Tools to monitor memory leak-
1.Heapdump
2.strongloop
