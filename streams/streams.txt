streams-
	-Streams are collections of data—just like arrays or strings. The difference is that streams might not be available all at once, 
	and they don’t have to fit in memory. This makes streams really powerful when working with large amounts of data,
	or data that’s coming from an external source one chunk at a time.
	
Type-
	1.A readable stream is an abstraction for a source from which data can be consumed. An example of that is the fs.createReadStream method.
	2.A writable stream is an abstraction for a destination to which data can be written. An example of that is the fs.createWriteStream method.
	3.A duplex streams is both Readable and Writable. An example of that is a TCP socket.
	4. A transform stream is basically a duplex stream that can be used to modify or transform the data as it is written and read.
		An example of that is the zlib.createGzip stream to compress the data using gzip.
