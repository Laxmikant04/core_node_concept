Process-
	Process is a global object in node js  which gives us the information about the current running process.
	As it's global object we don't need to import it.
	
Events-
	Exit -
		this event is called when process is about to exit . generally node process exits when event loop gets empty.
		
		process.on('exit'function(){
			console.log("on exit of process");
		})
		
	beforeExit-
		this event is scheduled to call just before exit event .
		once event loop is empty this event is called and generally we have such code block inside which prevents process from exit.
		
		process.on('beforeExit' function(err) {
			console.log('beforeExit');
		  });
		  
	uncaughtException -
		this event is called when there is any javascript uncought exceptions. for example calling an undefined function.
		process.on('uncaughtException' function(err) {
			console.log('Caught exception: ' + err);
		  });
		  
		  
there are many properties and function is process module which gives details about the process -
	console.log('Current directory: ' + process.cwd());
	console.log("process Evn details-"+JSON.stringify(process.env))
